### 0x1A. C - Hash tables

#### Overview
Welcome to the Hash Table Assignment! In this assignment, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of hash tables and their importance in computer science. The assignment is divided into several parts, starting with an introduction to hash functions and hash tables.

#### Introduction to Hash Tables
In this section, we'll lay the groundwork by understanding the basics of what a hash table is and why it is a crucial data structure in computer science. We'll discuss the key components and the role hash tables play in optimizing data retrieval.

#### Hash Function
A hash function is a core element of hash tables. In this part, we delve into the concept of hash functions, exploring how they convert input data into a fixed-size value, typically a hash code. Understanding the properties of a good hash function is essential for efficient hash table performance.

#### Hash Table
The hash table itself is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to specific indices. In this section, we'll explore the structure of a hash table, including collision resolution techniques, load factors, and the overall mechanism that makes hash tables a powerful tool for organizing and accessing data.

#### All About Hash Tables
This part is a comprehensive overview of hash tables, covering their advantages, use cases, and common implementations. We'll also discuss the trade-offs and considerations when choosing hash tables for specific scenarios.

#### Why Hash Tables and Not Arrays
The final part addresses a common question: Why use hash tables instead of simple arrays? We'll compare the strengths and weaknesses of hash tables against arrays, highlighting scenarios where hash tables shine and providing a deeper understanding of their role in software development.
